# CompSoc, SSC

Code for The CompSoc, St. Stephen's College's website. *Still under development...*

2. Change permissions for setup.sh using ```bash chmod +x setup.sh```.
3. Run setup.sh ```bash ./setup.sh```.

## Styling

The project uses Sass for the styles. All the Sass lives in (HA!) /static/sass. If editing the Sass, make sure you only compile main.scss in the Sass folder and nothing else. We recommend either CodeKit to watch for changes to the Sass and JavaScript but the Sass gem's watch method should work as well.
