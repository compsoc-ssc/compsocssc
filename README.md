## Contribute

Below are the instructions for contributing to the compsocssc repo.

1. Create a new branch for the new feature or bugfix. Branch out from master.
2. Develop the feature on it's own branch until complete and stable.
3. Create a pull request to merge into the level_up. Think of this as a beta branch.
4. level_up will be merged into master at regular intervals.

The features currently under development are:

* Orfik Calendar event (add_to_calendar branch)
* Events overhaul (fix_events branch)

## Styling

The project uses Sass for the styles. All the Sass lives in (HA!) /static/sass. If editing the Sass, make sure you only compile main.scss in the Sass folder and nothing else. We recommend either CodeKit to watch for changes to the Sass and JavaScript but the Sass gem's watch method should work as well.
