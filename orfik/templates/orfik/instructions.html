        <li>The hunt begins <strong>sharp</strong> at 0000 Hours on February 24, 2015.</li>
        <li>Each participant can make a single login using a username of their choice.</li>
        <li>Once the game begins you will be faced by a series of questions.</li>
        <li>All answers are to be entered in lower case characters with no spaces and special characters.</li>
        <li>You can only see one question at a time and will only progress when you answer the question correctly.</li>
        <li>You can have infinite tries on each question untill you get the right answer.</li>
        <li>All levels are of equal weightage. There is no negative marking.</li>
        <li>You can also see the leader board at any time to see your progress relative to other.</li>
        <li>Ranks are based on the time the question is answered; with the team (or individual) answering first placed higher.</li>
        <li>The CompSoc shall be the sole authority to decide on anything. Any decision made by CompSoc or its representatives are final and irrevocable.</li>
        <li>Any team (or individual) found to use any unfair means will be disqualified with immediate effect.</li>
        <li>The use of the internet, searching the source code etc. are all allowed to arrive at the answer.</li>
